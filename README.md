   # F1 Analysis App

   ## Overview
   The F1 Analysis App is a Streamlit-based application that provides various analyses and visualizations of Formula 1 data. The app includes features such as driver performance analysis, team performance analysis, pit stop strategies, and more. It leverages data science and machine learning techniques to offer insights and predictions about the F1 races and drivers.

   ## Features
   - **Driver Analysis**: Analyze driver performance, consistency, head-to-head comparisons, and track struggles.
   - **Race Analysis**: Compare qualifying vs race performance, analyze pit stop strategies, and lap time efficiency.
   - **Team Analysis**: Evaluate team performance, best team lineup, and struggling teams.
   - **Predictions and Trends**: Predict the 2025 season, championship retention, and champion age trends.
   - **Special Analysis**: Hypothetical driver swaps and driver movements.

   ## Technologies Used
   - **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web application.
   - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
   - **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
   - **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning models and predictions.
   - **NetworkX**: For network analysis and visualization of driver movements.
   - **Plotly**: For interactive plots and visualizations.

   Data
   The data directory should contain the necessary dataset files required for the analysis. Ensure that the data files are in the correct format and structure as expected by the data_loader.py script.

   Analysis and Predictions
   Driver Performance
   Analyzes the performance of drivers based on their race results, including metrics such as total races, wins, podiums, and points.

   Qualifying vs Race Performance
   Compares the qualifying positions of drivers with their race finish positions to identify patterns and correlations.

   Pit Stop Strategies
   Analyzes the number and duration of pit stops to understand their impact on race performance.

   Team Performance
   Evaluates the performance of teams based on their race results, including average finishing positions.

   Best Team Lineup
   Identifies the best team lineup based on average points per race for each driver.

   Struggling Teams
   Analyzes teams that are underperforming based on their average finishing positions.

   Predictions for 2025 Season
   Uses linear regression models to predict the performance of drivers and constructors for the 2025 season based on historical data.

   Championship Retention
   Analyzes the probability of championship retention by comparing the performance of champions across seasons.

   Champion Age Trends
   Analyzes the age distribution of championship winners to identify trends and patterns.

   Hypothetical Driver Swaps
   Analyzes the potential impact of swapping drivers between teams based on their performance metrics.

   Driver Movements
   Visualizes the movements of drivers between teams using network analysis.
